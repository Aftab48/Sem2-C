ðŸ‘‹ Hello

This is a repository for assignments for our Computer Programming Lab class.

## Repository Contents

This repository will contain the following:

* **Assignment Files:** Individual folders or files for each assignment, clearly named (e.g., `Assignment_1`, `Assignment_2a`, etc.).
* **Potentially:** Any supplementary materials, resources, or notes related to the assignments (if applicable).

## Repository Structure
```
Each assignment is organized in its own folder:

Assignment 1/
Assignment 2/
Assignment 3/

(and more as the course progresses)
```


Inside each folder, you will find the necessary files, documents, or any related material.

## Getting Started

You have two main ways to access the assignments in this repository:

### 1. Cloning the Repository (Recommended for Staying Updated)

Cloning the repository creates a local copy of the entire project on your computer. This is the recommended method if you plan to regularly check for new assignments or want to keep a local version synchronized with any updates.

**Steps to Clone:**

1.  **Ensure Git is Installed:** If you don't have Git installed on your system, you'll need to download and install it. You can find instructions for your operating system here: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2.  **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory on your computer where you want to store the repository.
3.  **Copy the Repository URL:** On the main page of this GitHub repository, click the green "Code" button. You'll see a dropdown menu. Copy the URL provided under "HTTPS" (or "SSH" if you have it configured).
4.  **Run the Clone Command:** In your terminal or command prompt, type the following command and paste the copied URL after `git clone`:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aftab48/Sem2-C.git
    ```

5.  **Access the Files:** Once the cloning process is complete, a new folder with the repository name will be created in your current directory. You can navigate into this folder to access the assignment files.

    ```bash
    cd your Sem2-C-main
    ```

### 2. Downloading Individual Files

If you only need a specific assignment and don't want to keep a local copy of the entire repository, you can download individual files directly from the GitHub website.

**Steps to Download:**

1.  **Navigate to the Assignment:** Browse through the repository to find the specific assignment file you need.
2.  **Click on the File:** Click on the name of the file.
3.  **Download:**
    * **For most text-based files (e.g., `.txt`, `.md`, `.c`):** You'll likely see the file content displayed. Look for a "Raw" button. Right-click on "Raw" and select "Save as..." to download the file. Alternatively, there might be a download icon (usually an arrow pointing downwards).
    * **For other file types (e.g., `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.zip`):** You should see a "Download" button directly on the file view page. Click it to download the file.

## Staying Updated

If you cloned the repository, you can easily update your local copy with any new assignments or changes I push to the repository. Simply navigate to the repository folder in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
git pull origin main
```
